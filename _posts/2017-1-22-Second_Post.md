title: Analyzing MTA Data Set
---

So I survivied my first week at Metis DS Bootcamp. I felt really comfortable about starting the bootcamp since I already had experiences with Python but it was way tougher than I thought. Without some sort of intro class, we jumped right into project. I had to put extra effort to pull everything on time and I am glad that I survived my first week!

#### First Project

The first project was a group project. We had five members in our team. It was a good ice breaker as well. The project was about alayzing MTA turnstile data available <a href='http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html'>here</a>. The objective of the project was to select neighborhoods or subway stations in New York City to promote an event. So basically we had to think about the business side of it before digging into the data. Because we had five team members with different background, it was really interesting to observe how everyone thinks differently and comes up with different approaches. 

#### Data Cleaning

Data cleaning took the most time for this project. We had to clean the messy data over and over to get the numbers we wanted. I had prior experiences with Pandas but I learned so many new things by cleaning the data over and over. Also, I was able to figure out more efficient ways of doing things by discussing with teammates. 

#### Result & Thoughts

It was really interesting working in a group. I've been working alone for so many years so it was quite difficult for me to really collaborate in the beginning. However, we were able to come up with some great ideas for this project and was able to pull things together in a short period of time. Interestingly, all of our team members were very good with Python unlike other teams. I was very satisfied with the result and feedback from the instructors. I was somewhat challenged and discouraged throughout my first week due to large amount of works and fast paced lectures. After completing this project, I feel like I gained more confidence about my skills (Pandas especially). I am looking forward to my next project.
