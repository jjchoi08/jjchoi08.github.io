title: Starting My Journey to Become a Data Scientist
---
<p>
A blog newbie and a former business analyst & software/DevOps engineer here. A year ago, I decided to make a career transition and become a data scientist in a (cool) tech company. Although I worked with data for many years, I mostly wrote SQL queries to create dashboard and manage reports (and maybe write simple programs to automate them). I was eager to solve real business problems with data and stay away from data operations roles. After spending about a year studying + job searching, I decided to join Metis Data Science Bootcamp program. In case you haven't heard about Metis, it's a 12-week intensive project-based full-time program where students learn various tools for machines learning & deep learning and do bunch of fun projects. Unlike other data science courses out there, Metis let students decide what to do for their projects and students are required to go through all processes in data science including data gathering, munging, cleaning, and presenting. Also, you get to meet many fellow data scientist apperentices, get invited for meetups, and have multiple speaker sessions from real data scientists in the field. 

So here I am writing a blog about what I am currently learning and other data science related stuffs that I'd like to share with others.

### Before joining Metis...
<p>
I started my career as a web developer in C#/.NET but soon made a transition to business analysis side. If you have any experiences in a dev team or with tech teams in a corporation, you'd know the struggle between tech and business teams is real. A Technical Business Analysts writes SQL queries daily, creates and manages documentation for applications, and participate in user acceptance testings. A business analyst plays an important role to liaise between developers and business users. After few years of BA experiences, I joined a cloud development team as a software engineer. I wrote Python production code and particiapted in development and deployment with <a href='https://www.chef.io/chef/'>Chef</a> and <a href ='https://www.docker.com/'>Docker</a>. It was an agile dev team with daily scrum meetings. With two week sprints, we would have demo friday to share the progress and extensively used git to pull, push, merge codes daily.
<br>
So when I gained interests in Data Science and decided to make a career transition once again, many of my skills were transferrable. SQL, Python, communication between technical and non-technical people, experiences in various open source tools, and experiences working with data were all very important as a data scientist. I could easily jump start to learn Python data analysis libraries, R, and data visualizations on my own. <br>

Because I had related experiences and skills, I was able to interview with many companies for data scientists & data analytics analysts roles for last few months. I learned so many things about current job market in this field and how to get interview requests with the top tech companies from my experiences but I will talk about that in another post. I received few offers for non-data science roles but I decided not to give up.

I first learned about Metis at <a href='https://www.odsc.com/'>Open Data Science Conference 2016 </a> in Santa Clara, CA few months ago. I was there to learn about current trend in Data Science as well as to meet professionals in the industry. Also, since I was interviewing with companies in the Bay area, I thought it would be a great opportunity to check out the tech scene and network. I went to <a href= 'http://www.rummanchowdhury.com/'>Rumman  Chowdry</a>'s  Data Science 101 session and first heard about Metis. It seemed like a great program to work on large scale projects with real data and learn about Data Science tools in-depth. Also, Metis has a great network with companies and alumnus in Data Science field. I was studying and job searching on my own for a year and it was tough. I knew Metis DS bootcamp would help me measure my current skills with others looking to become a data scientist and work on data projects that I could show / talk about during job interviews. As soon as I knew I was not selected for the role that I was interviewing, I applied for Metis DS bootcamp. I took a step back and decided to study more to make a comeback. I will post about my first two weeks at Metis Bootcamp in next posts!
