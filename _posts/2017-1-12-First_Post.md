title: A Little Bit About Myself...
---
<p>
A blog newbie and a former web-developer, business analyst & software/DevOps engineer here. A year ago, I decided to make a career transition and become a data scientist in a (cool) tech company. Although I worked with data for many years, I mostly wrote SQL queries to create dashboard and manage reports (and maybe write simple programs to automate them). I was eager to solve real business problems with data and stay away from data operations roles. After spending about a year studying + job searching, I decided to join Metis Data Science Bootcamp program. In case you haven't heard about Metis, it's a 12-week intensive project-based full-time program where students learn various tools for machines learning & deep learning and do bunch of fun projects. Unlike other data science courses out there, Metis lets students decide what to do for their projects and students are required to go through all processes in data science including data gathering, munging, cleaning, and presenting. Also, you get to meet many fellow data scientist apperentices, get invited for meetups, and have multiple speaker sessions from real data scientists in the field.

### My Background Transition...
<p>
I started my career as a web developer in C#/.NET but soon made a transition to business analysis side. If you have any experiences in a dev team or with tech teams in a corporation, you'd know the struggle between tech and business teams is real. A Technical Business Analyst writes SQL queries daily, creates and manages documentation for applications, and participates in user acceptance testings. A business analyst plays an important role in liaising between developers and business users, which is critical for a technical project to progress. After few years of BA experiences, I joined a cloud development team as a software engineer. I wrote Python production code and particiapted in development and deployment with <a href='https://www.chef.io/chef/'>Chef</a> and <a href ='https://www.docker.com/'>Docker</a>. It was an agile dev team with daily scrum meetings. With two week sprints, we would have demo friday to share the progress and extensively used git to pull, push, merge codes daily. So I was able to experience both Waterfall and Agile dev teams in action, which I think is really nice as a professional in tech industry.

When I gained interests in Data Science and decided to make a career transition once again, many of my skills were transferrable. 
My web-developer experiences helped me to easily learn D3.js (HTML + Javascript). My Python development experinces helped me to easily learn other data science libraries and to create web apps for data products. My business analyst experiences helped me to create DB, store data, and pull data for processing easily with SQL or NoSQL. Finally, my project management and consulting experiences helped me to understand how technical teams work in both large & small teams, how to manage/scale projects, and how to communicate effectively with non-tecnical audiences.  <br>

#### Metis Bootcamp

<p>

I first learned about Metis at <a href='https://www.odsc.com/'>Open Data Science Conference 2016 </a> in Santa Clara, CA few months ago. I was there to learn about current trend in Data Science as well as to meet professionals in the industry. Also, since I was interviewing with companies in the Bay area, I thought it would be a great opportunity to check out the tech scene and network. I went to Data Science 101 session and first heard about Metis. It seemed like a great program to work on large scale projects with real data and learn about Data Science tools in-depth. Also, Metis has a great network with companies and alumnus in Data Science field. I was studying and job searching on my own for a year and it was tough. I knew Metis DS bootcamp would help me measure my current skills with others looking to become a data scientist and work on data projects that I could show / talk about during job interviews. As soon as I knew I was not selected for the role that I was interviewing, I applied for Metis DS bootcamp. I will post about my projects at Metis for my next posts..
